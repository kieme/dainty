# dainty_oops
&lt;dainty::oops> is a small c++ error handling framework that encourage formalization.

under construction.

Dainty oops is the error handling mechanism used by the dainty framework. The dainty framework does not use c++ exceptions for a number of reasons that will be documented later on. <dainty::oops> offers a method for providing error handling, where certain things must be done and others are modifiable as to enforce correctness with some flexibility. Many years was invested to come up with this concept and API - curious to see if it was worth it.
