# private_dainty_dacli
a small c++ framework to manage, parse and build defined arguments that can be used for messaging, user interaction and more.

under construction. Code comes from another library I have written and I have not been able to rename everything (used to call it Strict-Sefined CommmandLine Interface, and now its call Defined Argument CommandLine Interface).

dacli is both an interface description and how to process it. The md file decribes the intention. I'm only partly finished with the code transformation from the old library to the new library.
